            <p>
              Hi, My name is Oluwatosin, a Records Manager at my regular job, a
              drummer sometimes and a retired footballer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started taking Front End Engineering course on AltSchool Africa
              to gain more knowledge and learn in an actual school. Although it
              has not been easy because i have to combine learning with work.
              Most times i miss live classes, but i try my best to rewatch the
              live sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
              There really isn't much about my self to talk about, i live a very
              boring life and only have three places i go to, work, church and
              my house and support manchester united. I beleieve we will be back
              soon.
